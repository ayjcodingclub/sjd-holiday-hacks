# Welcome to your very own Holiday Hacks repository! ‚òÉÔ∏è
Thank you so much for taking part in Holday Hacks! This is your group's repo for the hackathon. Use it to submit files, work with your team, and ask questions.

Check out the example.cpp file to get started! (No pressure to code in C++, pick whatever language you want!) 

## What's Holiday Hacks?
In teams of 1-4, make something cool in your favourite programming language with a holiday or winter theme! Start working on the 9th and join us for a demo party on December 16th.  No coding experience required!
